# bliss_rr

Program for spatial interpolation that allows to choose between multiple statistical interpolation schemes, such as:

* OI_multiscale. Modified Optimal Interpolation based on observations only.
* OI_firstguess. Optimal Interpolation based on the combination of observations with a background field. It is possible to specify a data transformation as a pre-processing step (i.e., Gaussian anamorphosis).
